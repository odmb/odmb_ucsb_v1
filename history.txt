V01-01: 29 April 2013, Manuel
--------------------------------
Fixed the V2 test bench. Notice that now the V1 test bench is not compatible.
Changed file_handler.v to accept hex input vectors.
Added vmeconfregs.vhd to avoid JTAG to set registers.
Tested cfebjtag and testctrl successfully in simulation.

V01-00: 25 April 2013, Manuel
--------------------------------
Added V2 top and ucf files. It syntesizes.
The V2 test bench is incomplete.


V00-07: 22 April 2013, Manuel
--------------------------------
Synthesized the project in ISE, and added testctrl.vhd which stores
the LCTs, L1As, and BX in FIFOs writeable and readable by VME.

V00-06: 17 April 2013, Manuel
--------------------------------
Made all the paths relative.
Added daq_optical_out (optical TX) to the top.

V00-05: 17 April 2013, Manuel
--------------------------------
After delaying the output enable for the data FIFOs by 1.5 clock cycles, 
DDU packets are continuously written to the DDU FIFOs.
